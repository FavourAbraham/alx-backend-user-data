# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## 📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing **Basic Authentication** in a simple API using Python and Flask. It demonstrates the authentication process, Base64 encoding, and sending authorization headers. While Basic Authentication should typically be handled using well-established frameworks or modules in a professional setting, this project walks you through the mechanism step-by-step for learning purposes.

- Define what authentication means.
- Explain the concept and usage of Base64.
- Encode a string in Base64.
- Describe Basic Authentication and its implementation.
- Send the `Authorization` header in HTTP requests.
